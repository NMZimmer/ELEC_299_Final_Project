// ELEC 299 Final Competetition Notes


		Ideas:
		

NO HUMAN INTERVENTION

	Movement:
Have cases for each type of reading for the light sensors
---- i.e. if only left see dark, move slightly left so that it stays on lines

	Turning:
Use Encoders to turn a number of degrees:
---- would both or only 1 wheel turning help?
---- with only 1 wheel, could have either both or 2 motor on

	Stopping:
Move backwards slightly when stopping?
---- Would help 

Only Force motors to 0
---- no guess work, could try and predict times where stopping is needed, 
	 could be self corrected

How do we wanna do this? Encoders? Photo-sensors?

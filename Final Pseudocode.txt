Pseudocode:

Define constants
	ASCII Characters
	Pin Definitions
	
	
setup:
Read IR into int
	If this doesnt work after ‘x’ time, 
		turn and look for other robots, determine position based upon other positions
End setup


Loop:
If a = left, right or centre
		Call corresponding function
		Break
End loop


Functions Definitions: 

(Route)//Routes are Hardcoded and predetermined to be fast with no collisions
	if L
		Follow predetermine L path
			call forward, turn, correct, pick up, etc as necessary
	else if C or R 
		Follow Corresponding Paths, similar to L 
	end if

(Forward) (number of intersections)
	turn motors on
	if all 3 IR sensors on //count intersections passes 
		count 1 intersection
	end if
	if count == number of intersections
		stop
	end if
		
(Check Position)
	Turn left 90 degrees
		Measure distance using front IR sensor
			if object close 
				there is a robot on the left
			end if
	repeat for right side
	return position ASCII Character
			
				
(turn)(direction, degrees)
	convert degrees to number of Linear Encoder changes
	adjust motor directions and speed to follow direction
	count changes in Linear Encoders while count < degrees
	if count > degrees
		Stop
	end if

(correct) //corrects if not straight 
	if left IR sensor on
		turn right (small amount)
	else if right IR sensor on
		turn left small amount
	end if

(Pick up)
	move forward until IR Sensor good distance away
	if bumpers activated
		back up
	end if
	move actuators to ball
	close grip
	if grip sensor active
		stop closing
	end if
